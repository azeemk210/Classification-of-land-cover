"We will classify the Landsat image we've been working with using a supervised classification approach which incorporates the training data we worked with in [chapter 4](chapter_4_vector.ipynb). Specifically, we will be using the [RandomForest (Brieman 2001)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324) ensemble decision tree algorithm by [Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm). The RandomForest algorithm has recently become extremely popular in the field of remote sensing, and is quite fast when compared to some other machine learning approaches (e.g., SVM can be quite computationally intensive). This isn't to say that it is the best per se; rather it is a great first step into the world of machine learning for classification and regression.\n",
